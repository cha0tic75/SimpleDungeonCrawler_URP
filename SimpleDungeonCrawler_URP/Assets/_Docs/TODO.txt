TODO:

08/10/2022:
    - Created a new Interaction system, that will do an overlapsphere to look for any colliders that have a 
      Interactable component.  If so, then it will call its interact method, which in turn calls HandleInteraction
      on all the InteractionHandlers attached.

      NOTE: There is a strange issue where it will not find the Exit Interactable script if the player currently has 
      an item in their inventory.


    - Also, the Item_SO has a concept of ItemBehaviour but it is currently not being used.


    - Now that the player has movement and can pick up "items", Create an exit system that when player
      enters a trigger volume for an exit, and they interact, it will check the player inventory 
      for a specific key and if they are holding it, open the exit and destroy the key. otherwise
      nothing happens

    - Totally revamp the system:  When player presses the interact button, it will look for an
      interactable and cal its interact method on it.  Any interactable will have an interactable
      script on it as well as some sort of InteractionHandler
      (IE: ItemInteractionHandler or ExitInteractionHandler)
