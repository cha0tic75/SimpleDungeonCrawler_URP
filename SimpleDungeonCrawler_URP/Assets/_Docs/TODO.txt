    - Refactor the Stat System and the Damage System
      The Damage System should be able to cause damage to any stat.  IE Health or Stamina
      The best approach is to refactor the StatSystem:
        BaseStatComponent>RegeStatComponent  BaseStatComponent will have a reference to a StatType_SO
        And have Exposed method(s): Consume() which removes from current and Apply() which adds to it.
        Consume() will be within the IDamagable interface and BaseStatComponent will implement it.
        Apply() will be part of the IHealable interface and BaseStatComponent will also implement this.

        The damagableProviders will also have a reference to a StatType_SO and will grab ALL components
        on the collider that implement IDamagable.  Then filter it to match its reference to StatType_SO.
        This is what will be provided to the DamageDealer

    - The BaseStatComponent needs some sort of means to test if it can regenerate(Besides not having any damage or not sprinting)
      IE: it would be cool to only allow the players health to regen if they are not moving:

    - Refactored the damage system to use composition.  This allows me to add a DamagableProvider
      which is the means of detecting the IDamagable. As well as DamageDealerHandlers which determine 
      how the damage is applied(One time or continuous while colliding or triggering)

    - Use Shader Graph to create a shader for the electric wall flicker.  This will cause the effect to 
      be handle on the GPU side rather than the CPU.

    - Extended the map, Created more keys, Added animation for open door, Created a TeleportInteractable
    - Refactored DamageDealer to be base class then CollisionDamageDealer and TriggerDamageDealer derive 
      from it.  Then concrete implementations WallCollisionDamageDealer and TrapTriggerDamageDealer.
    - I plugged in some UI for health and stamina.  Health seems to be working good.  
      I need to plug in the stamina one.

     Health:  This should regenerate if player isn't moving or being damaged.

     Stamina: This should have a value like health that is consumed when the player is sprinting.
              The PlayerController should not allow player to move faster if out of stamina.
              Stamina should regen when player isn't moving.

    - flesh out the rest of the level geometry and place the appropriate keys.
    - Create some concept of enemy. This can be as simple as a square that moves up and down 
      at regular intervals.

    - Refactor the Damage dealer!  There should be TriggerVolume and CollisionVolume components
      Then TriggerVolumeHandler and CollisionVolumeHandler  This is where the damage should come from
      This will enable me to use triggerVolume to do other things like start enemies bouncing around 
      or something.
