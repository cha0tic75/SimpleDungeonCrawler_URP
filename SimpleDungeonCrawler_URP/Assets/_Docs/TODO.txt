TODO:

    - Create some sort of simple Animation for the ExitInteractionHandler to play when the door is open.
      It seems silly to just destroy the object.  We may want to close it after a fixed time or something.


    - Now that the player has movement and can pick up "items", Create an exit system that when player
      enters a trigger volume for an exit, and they interact, it will check the player inventory 
      for a specific key and if they are holding it, open the exit and destroy the key. otherwise
      nothing happens

    - Totally revamp the system:  When player presses the interact button, it will look for an
      interactable and cal its interact method on it.  Any interactable will have an interactable
      script on it as well as some sort of InteractionHandler
      (IE: ItemInteractionHandler or ExitInteractionHandler)
