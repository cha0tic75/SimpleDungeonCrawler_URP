TODO:

08/10/2022:
    - Extended the map, Created more keys, Added animation for open door, Created a TeleportInteractable
    - Refactored DamageDealer to be base class then CollisionDamageDealer and TriggerDamageDealer derive 
      from it.  Then concrete implementations WallCollisionDamageDealer and TrapTriggerDamageDealer.
    - I plugged in some UI for health and stamina.  Health seems to be working good.  
      I need to plug in the stamina one.

     Health:  This should regenerate if player isn't moving or being damaged.

     Stamina: This should have a value like health that is consumed when the player is sprinting.
              The PlayerController should not allow player to move faster if out of stamina.
              Stamina should regen when player isn't moving.

    - flesh out the rest of the level geometry and place the appropriate keys.
    - Create some concept of enemy. This can be as simple as a square that moves up and down 
      at regular intervals.

    - Refactor the Damage dealer!  There should be TriggerVolume and CollisionVolume components
      Then TriggerVolumeHandler and CollisionVolumeHandler  This is where the damage should come from
      This will enable me to use triggerVolume to do other things like start enemies bouncing around 
      or something.
